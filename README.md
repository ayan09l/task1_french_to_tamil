# task1_french_to_tamil
A Flask-based French → Tamil Translator built for my Nullclass Internship Task-1. This machine-learning project translates only 5-letter French words into Tamil through an English intermediary. Includes a glitch-style UI, strict word-length validation, and a clean, professional web interface.
